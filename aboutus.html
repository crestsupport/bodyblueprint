  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>At Body Blueprint®, our mission is to make health and wellness accessible, practical, and sustainable for everyone. We believe that lasting change comes from building habits rooted in balanced nutrition, approachable fitness routines, and lifestyle strategies that fit real life. Our philosophy is simple: empower individuals with clear, actionable guidance that helps them thrive day to day.</p>

  <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
  <p>We focus on ancestral principles backed by modern science, presented in a way that is easy to follow and adaptable to different lifestyles. Each guide is designed to help you take meaningful steps toward improved energy, focus, and overall well-being — without overwhelming complexity.</p>

  <h2>Our Guides</h2>
  <p>Body Blueprint® offers three tiered guides, each expanding in depth and detail:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Beginner:</strong> A foundation of simple recipes and lifestyle strategies. Perfect for those starting their wellness journey or looking for approachable, everyday guidance.</li>
    <li><strong>Intermediary:</strong> Builds on the basics with deeper sequencing, enhanced practices, and more variety. Designed for individuals ready to take the next step in refining their routines.</li>
    <li><strong>Elite-Plus:</strong> Our most comprehensive guide, featuring 90 recipes, advanced strategies, and lifestyle mastery. Ideal for those seeking a complete, structured approach to long-term wellness.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Use the Guides</h2>
  <p>Each guide is intended as an educational resource. You can explore recipes, follow suggested routines, and adapt strategies to your personal context. The guides are flexible — they are not prescriptive programs, but tools to help you make informed choices and build sustainable habits.</p>

  <h2>Important Note</h2>
  <p>Body Blueprint® guides are for educational purposes only. They are <strong>not</strong> a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult a licensed healthcare provider before making significant changes to your diet, fitness, or lifestyle, especially if you have existing health conditions or concerns.</p>
