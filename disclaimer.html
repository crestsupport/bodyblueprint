    <h2>Educational purpose only</h2>
    <p>Body Blueprint® provides educational content related to nutrition, fitness, and lifestyle. All materials—including guides, webpages, videos, emails, ads, and social content—are for informational purposes and are not a substitute for professional advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Not medical advice</h2>
    <p>Nothing on our site or in our materials constitutes medical advice. Do not disregard, avoid, or delay obtaining medical or health-related advice from your healthcare professional because of something you have read or seen in Body Blueprint® materials.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consult first:</strong> Speak with a licensed physician or qualified healthcare provider before starting any nutrition, fitness, or lifestyle program—especially if you are pregnant or nursing, have a diagnosed condition, take prescription or over-the-counter medications, or have specific dietary needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Emergencies:</strong> If you believe you may be experiencing a medical emergency, call your local emergency number immediately.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>No individualized or professional relationship</h2>
    <p>Use of Body Blueprint® materials does not create a patient–physician, coach–client, dietitian–client, or any professional relationship. We do not provide individualized nutrition counseling, medical services, or personalized fitness programming within our public materials.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Fitness risks and personal responsibility</h2>
    <p>Exercise involves inherent risks, including but not limited to musculoskeletal strain, cardiovascular events, and injury. By choosing to follow any fitness suggestions, you assume full responsibility for selecting appropriate intensity, progressions, equipment, and environment.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Environment & equipment:</strong> Ensure safe setup, proper form, and appropriate equipment condition and use.</li>
      <li><strong>Stop if needed:</strong> Discontinue any activity that causes pain, dizziness, shortness of breath beyond normal exertion, or unusual discomfort, and consult a professional.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Nutrition considerations, allergies, and intolerances</h2>
    <p>Recipes, meal ideas, and nutrition guidance are general and may not suit all individuals. Verify ingredient lists and potential allergens (e.g., nuts, dairy, gluten, shellfish) and adapt based on your needs and healthcare provider guidance.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Medical conditions:</strong> Individuals with conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, gastrointestinal disorders, or eating disorders should consult their healthcare provider before making dietary changes.</li>
      <li><strong>Intolerances:</strong> Monitor for intolerances and adverse reactions; discontinue and consult a professional if reactions occur.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <p>Our ads and promotional materials (including on platforms such as YouTube) are designed to comply with applicable advertising policies. We avoid claims that suggest diagnosis, cure, or guaranteed outcomes, and we do not present before–after imagery in a misleading manner.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No misleading claims:</strong> We avoid unsubstantiated claims, exaggerated benefits, or urgency language that implies guaranteed outcomes.</li>
      <li><strong>Health-related content:</strong> Health and wellness promotions are presented as educational guidance, not medical advice or treatments.</li>
      <li><strong>Content updates:</strong> Advertising policies may change; we periodically review and update materials for compliance.</li>
