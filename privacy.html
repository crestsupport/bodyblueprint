    <li><strong>Payment information:</strong> Processed securely via Stripe or PayPal. We do not store full credit card numbers.</li>
    <li><strong>Access tokens:</strong> Secure, unguessable tokens used to verify guide access.</li>
    <li><strong>Device and browser data:</strong> IP address, browser type, operating system, and usage statistics for analytics and optimization.</li>
    <li><strong>Marketing and engagement data:</strong> Information collected via cookies, pixels, or analytics tools to measure ad performance and user engagement.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To deliver purchased content securely and verify access.</li>
    <li>To respond to inquiries, provide customer support, and resolve issues.</li>
    <li>To improve our website, products, and user experience.</li>
    <li>To comply with legal, regulatory, and tax obligations.</li>
    <li>To personalize marketing and advertising campaigns in compliance with platform policies (e.g., YouTube, Google Ads).</li>
    <li>To detect, prevent, and address fraud, unauthorized access, or misuse of our services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
  <p>We use cookies and similar technologies for analytics, performance monitoring, and advertising compliance. You may disable cookies in your browser settings, but some features may not function properly. Third-party platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, YouTube Ads) may also use cookies or tracking technologies subject to their own policies.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We rely on trusted third-party providers such as Stripe and PayPal for payment processing, and analytics platforms for performance measurement. These providers may collect and process data in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review those policies directly.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Access tokens are retained only for the duration of product access validity.</p>

  <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>If you access our services from outside the United States, your information may be transferred to and processed in the U.S. or other jurisdictions. We take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for such transfers.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our services are intended for adults. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such data, please contact us to request deletion.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR in the EU, CCPA in California), you may have rights including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access to the personal data we hold about you.</li>
    <li>Correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
    <li>Deletion of your personal data (“right to be forgotten”).</li>
    <li>Restriction or objection to certain processing activities.</li>
    <li>Data portability, allowing you to request a copy of your information in a structured format.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:bbp_spport@outlook.com">bbp_spport@outlook.com</a>. We will respond promptly and in accordance with applicable law.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We implement industry-standard security measures, including HTTPS encryption, secure token validation, and restricted access protocols. While we strive to protect your data, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>Advertising Compliance</h2>
  <p>We adhere to advertising platform policies (including YouTube and Google Ads) by avoiding misleading claims, ensuring transparency in data use, and respecting user privacy preferences. Any data used for advertising is aggregated or anonymized where possible.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in practices, technology, or legal requirements. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised effective date. Continued use of our services after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
